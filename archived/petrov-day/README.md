This bot traded on "[What % of Petrov Day will elapse before someone uses the big red button to take down Less Wrong's frontpage?](https://manifold.markets/Multicore/what-of-petrov-day-will-elapse-befo)".

If a human (i.e. not V or BotLab) buys NO and moves the prediction into the past, the bot assumes the button has been pressed and shuts down.

If the prediction becomes in the past in some other way (either due to V/BotLab buying NO or simply due to the past expanding to include former future), the bot buys YES to move the prediction to the present.

At some point I might turn this into a general-purpose bot for "when" markets, but currently there isn't enough money in them.
