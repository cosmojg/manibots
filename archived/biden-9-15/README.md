This bot buys NO on "[Will Biden be president on 9/15 [Resolves to MKT]](https://manifold.markets/jack/will-biden-be-president-on-915-reso)".

It's an ugly pile of heuristics that tries to move the market as low as possible, while staying within limited budget, and with random delays that are meant to annoy Team Truth humans. There is a bug that involves a race condition with V and/or BotLab, but I kept it because it made this bot even less predictable and more annoying for Team Truth humans.

In case it wasn't clear from the previous paragraph: **Please don't write real bots like this.**
