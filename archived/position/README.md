The average binary market on Manifold resolves to about 40%-43%. This bot looks for new markets with 0 bets and buys NO.

The bot ignores markets which contain blacklisted words and phrases such as `@pos` and `this market`.

UPD: Turns out the average was being pulled down by CEP and CART tournaments. Without them the average resolution is too close to 50% to be profitable.
